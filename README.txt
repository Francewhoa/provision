The Aegir system
================

The Aegir hosting system allows developers and site administrators to
automate many of the common tasks associated with deploying and
managing large websites. Aegir makes it easy to install, upgrade,
deploy, and backup an entire network of Drupal sites.

This is the backend of the Aegir hosting system. The front end and
back end are designed to be run separately, and each front end will
also be able to drive multiple back ends.

The most up to date information regarding the project and its goals
can be found on the Aegir website and the community portal:
