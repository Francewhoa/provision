# The New Provision

Provision is a command-line interface for managing servers and quickly deploying websites and services.

You can use it to launch Drupal quickly on your own computer, locally or on a server.

## Origins

Provision, prior to the 4.x branch, was the "back-end" command line interface for the Aegir Hosting Project, implemented as a set of Drush commands.

## Mission

If this project is to succeed we must make it our mission for Provision to be:

* Easy to use.
* Easy to develop.
* Flexible and simple.
* Open to change, open to all.

## Goals

* Quickly launch Drupal and other websites from source code.
* Be _Service_ Agnostic and pluggable. Support any web server \(Apache, Nginx, Docker, Kubernetes, `php -s`\), any database server \(MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite\). Allow contributed services.
* Run Anywhere. PHP-CLI works on Mac, Linux, Local, Metal, or Cloud. \(Windows support should be possible, especially since you can now run ubuntu bash\).

## Target Users

Provision is being designed for _everybody involved in building and hosting websites_: 

* Site builders and HTML/CSS designers who just want Drupal running locally.
* Web Developers who want to launch copies of websites quickly locally and in CI for testing.
* Systems Admins who want to just get Drupal running \(and updated\) without a lot of hassle.
* Platform Builders who are running Drupal as a Service and need to safely scale the number of sites they are responsible for.

Please join the conversation and submit an issue with your perspective on how we can improve how Provision works for your use case.
